# lite-shell
Lightweight Windows command shell

## Build instructions
A C++17 compiler (in Windows, of course) is required. To build the source files, navigate to the root of the repository and run
```bash
>scripts\build
```
This batch script will build the executables under the `build/` directory, which contains the command shell `shell.exe`.
